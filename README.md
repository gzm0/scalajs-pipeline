# The Scala.js compilation pipeline

Slides and source code for my Scala.js compilation pipeline class.

## Abstract

This talk will give you a deep insight into the moving parts that were
required to make Scala.js production ready. After laying out the
internal parts of the Scala.js compilation, linking and optimization
pipeline, we deep-dive into selected components in an attempt to
demystify Scalac's JavaScript back-end.

## Bio

Tobias Schlatter is one of the Scala.js core contributors and has
accompanied Scala.js from an early post-proof of concept stage to
production readiness during his time at LAMP, EPFL. He actively
maintains major parts of the Scala.js core project and takes an active
role in shaping Scala.js' future.
